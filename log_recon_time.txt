----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! ----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.

PTB-INFO: This is Psychtoolbox-3 for Microsoft Windows, under Matlab 64-Bit (Version 3.0.12 - Build date: Aug 26 2014).
PTB-INFO: Support status on this operating system release: Windows version 6.2 partially supported.
PTB-INFO: Type 'PsychtoolboxVersion' for more detailed version information.
PTB-INFO: Most parts of the Psychtoolbox distribution are licensed to you under terms of the MIT License, with
PTB-INFO: some restrictions. See file 'License.txt' in the Psychtoolbox root folder for the exact licensing conditions.

PTB-INFO: Will disable DWM because a regular fullscreen onscreen window is opened -> We want best timing and performance.

PTB-INFO: for it. This will introduce a very small and constant offset (typically << 1 msec). Read 'help BeampositionQueries'
PTB-INFO: for how to correct this, should you really require that last few microseconds of precision.
PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to
PTB-INFO: enable the beamposition workaround, as explained in 'help ConserveVRAM', section 'kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround'.

PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from beamposition = 6.944335 ms [144.002276 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Will use beamposition query for accurate Flip time stamping.
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 6.943118 ms [144.027510 Hz]. (50 valid samples taken, stddev=0.047266 ms.)
PTB-INFO: Reported monitor refresh interval from operating system = 6.944444 ms [144.000000 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.

PTB-WARNING: SHOW UP AT ALL! DO NOT USE THIS MODE FOR RUNNING REAL EXPERIMENT SESSIONS WITH ANY REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCURATE TIMING!

PTB-INFO: Support for fast OffscreenWindows enabled.
PTB-ERROR: OpenML timestamping reports that flip completed before it was scheduled [Scheduled no earlier than 10701.634690 secs, completed at 10700.208817 secs]!
PTB-ERROR: This could mean that sync of bufferswaps to vertical retrace is broken or some other driver bug! Switching to alternative timestamping method.
PTB-ERROR: Check your system setup!

PTB-INFO: Using specially modified PortAudio engine, based on offical version: PortAudio V19-devel WITH-DIM

Will use ASIO enhanced Portaudio driver DLL. See Psychtoolbox/PsychSound/PortAudioLICENSE.txt
for the exact terms of use for this dll.

Found at least one ASIO enabled soundcard in your system. Good, will use that in low-latency mode!
PTB-INFO: New audio device with handle 0 opened as PortAudio stream:
PTB-INFO: For 2 channels Playback: Audio subsystem is ASIO, Audio device name is ASIO Fireface USB
PTB-INFO: Real samplerate 44100.000000 Hz. Input latency 1.723356 msecs, Output latency 2.108844 msecs.

WARNING: Failed to load GetCharJava Java class. Most likely your Matlab
WARNING: classpath.txt file is not up to date. I will try to auto-fix this for

WARNING: This may have bad side-effects, like clearing all your scripts variables
WARNING: and functions! If it works, please read 'help PsychJavaTrouble'
WARNING: for a proper and permanent fix to the problem.

PsychJavaTrouble: Will now try to add the PsychJava folder to Matlabs dynamic classpath...
PsychJavaTrouble: Added PsychJava folder to dynamic class path. Psychtoolbox Java commands should work now!

Snd(): Initializing PsychPortAudio driver for sound output.

PTB-INFO: Master-Abort key '@' pressed by user.
PTB-INFO: Enforcing script abortion and restoring desktop by executing Screen('CloseAll') now!
PTB-INFO: Please ignore the false error message (INTERNAL PSYCHTOOLBOX ERROR) caused by this...


PTB-INFO: There are still 277 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 38 times out of a total of 5786 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.



WARNING: This session of your experiment was run by you with the setting Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1).
WARNING: This means that some internal self-tests and calibrations were skipped. Your stimulus presentation timing
WARNING: may have been wrong. This is fine for development and debugging of your experiment, but for running the real
WARNING: study, please make sure to set Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 0) for maximum accuracy and reliability.
